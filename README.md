## General information about this project of HCI:
This university project was created for the course of 'Human Computer Interaction' during the 8th semester at ΝΤUA and more specifically at the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. The task was to develop an application based in three (3) major axes. 

1st Axe: Human-centered Computational Examples

Our application has technical characteristics of: User Adaptation, Internet of Things (IoT) and Social Computing.

2nd Axe: Human Interaction with the smart devices in the physical word

The input system we used is the smartphone touch screen, the use of which is essential in order to use the application.

3rd Axe: Connectivity

One of the main connectivity tools we used, is the GPS, with the help of which the user is able to find the best parking lot in the nearby area.

## Project description:
The app is named EasyParking, its category is 'Map and Navigation' with the punchline being 'No parking lot, No problem'. 
Both smartphone and tablet users are able to install this app. The main purpose is to diminish the time needed to find free parking space in accordance with their current position and have access to amazing gifts. The users have to be able to login and register, choose private or public parking. Last but not least, they have to be able to see a list with all the needed information to find which parking suits best their interests.

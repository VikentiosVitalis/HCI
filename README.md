# General information about this project of HCI:
This university project was created for the course of 'Human Computer Interaction' during the 8th semester at ΝΤUA and more specifically at the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. The task was to develop an application based in three (3) major axes. 

1st Axe: Human-centered Computational Examples
Our application has technical characteristics of: User Adaptation, Internet of Things (IoT) and Social Computing.

2nd Axe: Human Interaction with the smart devices in the physical word
The input system we used is the smartphone touch screen, the use of which is essential in order to use the application.

3rd Axe: Connectivity
One of the main connectivity tools we used, is the GPS, with the help of which the user is able to find the best parking slot in the nearby area.
